 * Return true if the patterns provided contain any magic glob characters,

 *
 * Brace expansion is not considered "magic" unless the `magicalBraces` option
 * is set, as brace expansion just turns one string into an array of strings.
 * So a pattern like `'x{a,b}y'` would return `false`, because `'xay'` and
 * `'xby'` both do not contain any magic glob characters, and it's treated the
 * same as if you had called it on `['xay', 'xby']`. When `magicalBraces:true`
 * is in the options, brace expansion _is_ treated as a pattern having magic.
